# Reproduction

Bootstrap script

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Veetaha/rollup-default-export-warning-repro.git
cd rollup-default-export-warning-repro
npm i
npm run package
```

`original-project.output.js` is the output of code that I took from the debugger
after it was transformed by `commonjs` plugin. Please see `// COMMENT:` there.
